Cheat on Github and Git

### Delete one specific folder in Github
git rm -r folder-name


### Add all files
git add .

### Commit the file
git commit -m 'this is a commit'


### fatal: remote origin already exists.
It means pretty much what it says, the remote origin already exists, ie. you've already set it up before. You can type `git remote -v` to see what/where remotes are set. If you made a mistake before you can type `git remote rm origin` to clear it out and try again.
