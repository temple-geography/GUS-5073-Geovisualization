## Configure Python environment through Anaconda
Python is an increasingly popular high-level programming language. It emphasizes legibility over highly complex structure. Python innately provides simple data structures allowing for easy data manipulation. Python provides a simple approach to object-oriented programming, which in turn allows for intuitive programming, and has resulted in a large user community that has created numerous libraries that extend the basic capacities of the language.

The Anaconda makes configuring Python programing environment super easy. The Anaconda is cross-platform and it is very easy to install different libraries in the virtual environment. The following tutorial will walk you through the tutorial for installing Anaconda and required Python modules.
